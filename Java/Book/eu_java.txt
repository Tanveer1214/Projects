5. Thread-Local Handshakes
		It introduces a way to execute a callback on threads without performing a global VM safepoint. Makes it both possible and cheap to stop individual threads and not just all threads or none.
6. Time-Based Release Versioning
		It revises the version-string scheme of the Java SE Platform and the JDK, and related versioning information, for present and future time-based release models.
7. Root Certificates
		It provides a default set of root Certification Authority (CA) certificates in the JDK.
8. Heap Allocation on Alternative Memory Devices
		It enables the HotSpot VM to allocate the Java object heap on an alternative memory device, such as an NV-DIMM, specified by the user.
9. Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler
		It enables the Java-based JIT compiler, Graal, to be used as an experimental JIT compiler on the Linux/x64 platform.

Spring Security{
	Attacks {
		Injection(SQL, LDAP, XPath, or NoSQL queries, OS commands, XML parsers, SMTP headers, expression languages, and ORM queries)
		Session Fixation:  is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session.
		Clickjacking	:  is a malicious technique of tricking a user into clicking on something different from what the user perceives.
		Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they’re currently authenticated
		XSS:		 attacks enable attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users
	}
	Encoding:  the process of changing data representation i.e decimal to Hex
	Compression: algorithms are techniques that exploit redundancy in data to reduce the size of the data representation
	Hashing: is a method of one-way encryption, once you hashed the data can't be revert back to plain text.
	Encryption: is a two-way process, it can be revert to back to plaintext.
				Usually is the process of concealing information solely based on the secrecy of some smaller value.

	Symmetric				Asymmetric
	secret key				public/private key
	key length 256/512		minimium recommended 2048

consumer group
-- is used for processing request in concurrently
-- each consumer which having same group id is assign a partition of that topic
--there is is group coordinator that is take care of assign partition and load balancing/send to consumers

Tombstone Record: When using compacted topics, a record with a null value (also called a tombstone record) represents the deletion of a key

}


AOP which design pattern used?
	cross cutting concerns?

return with dynamic/static polymorphism 
	--gives same error is in it's own class, already exist method with same signature in class/parent class(incompitable return type)  
throws exception > parant/child method remove/add 
	compiler follows the method signature in signature method name and parameter and their sequence matters, 
	for return type will give error
	for throws exception does not matter either in parent nor child

The following 5 concepts make up our SOLID principles:
	Single Responsibility
	Open/Closed
	Liskov Substitution
	Interface Segregation

ACID properties{
Atomcity:    all the modified data are performed or none of them will be.
Consistency: maintains data integrity constraints, leaving the data consistent.
Isolation: ensuring that the transaction will not be changed by any other concurrent transaction.
Durability: changes are persisted permanently in the database.

- HashCode Method & Equal methods. what are the contract?

Map<String,ClazzA> clazzAMap = new HashMap();

1) Collection 
	- Why Collection doesn’t implements Cloneable and Serializable interfaces?
	- Thread safe & non thread safe.   //Vector, Hashtable, Stack(check), ConcurrentHashMap
	- Unique and non unique			/map(key),set->childs  
	- ArrayList & Array [Custom ArrayList implementation -> Add method code. 3 variable, capacity, current index, arrayElement (object type)] initial capacity 10, 1.5*current capacity(10)= new capacity = 15,
	- Hash Map. how hash works?
	- Which works FAST, Array or Hash, Searching n soritng fast?
	- HashCode Method & Equal methods. what are the contract?
	- Linked list.
	- fail-fast  vs  fail-safe
	- Vector is a thread safe collection
	- hash table
	- Hash map - non synchronize.
	- concurrentHashMap vs SynchronizedMap(Collection has Synchronized for Map/List/Set which provide thread safety for un-thread collection)
	- Array vs ArrayList
	- Vector vs ArrayList
	- ArrayList vs LinkedList(LinkedList maintained insertion of order where ArrayList not)
	- List vs Set (set stores Unique  elements where list stores non unique	)
	- TreeSet vs HashSet  (TreeSet is sorted where Hashset is unsorted)
	- HashMap(insertion order is random) vs LinkedHashMap(insertion order of keys)
	- TreeMap(sorted) vs LinkedHashMap(insertion order of keys) vs HashMap(insertion order is random)

Multi Threads:
	- Different methods of threads. 
	- functions
	- wait() , yeild(), sleep(), join(), 
	- thread pooling & its frameworks

Synchronization
		- Implementation.
		- Method Level and Block Level. which one is fast?
		- synchronization on static method,
		- object level threading. sol: make static mathod
		
	Class A implements Runnable{
		private int id;
		private String name;
		
		public synchronized void methodA(){
		System.out.println("MethodA executed");
		}
		
		 public void run() {

	obj.execute(new A());
	obj.execute(new A());	
	obj.shutdown();

Serialization
		- To Transfer Dtos. [Data transfer object]
		- Object ki state ki bytestream me convert krke save krdeti hai.
		- De-serialization.
		- * Serial UUID. (concept) -> class k andr id calculate krke deserialize krke multple classes tou nhi pare hue.
		- Attacks
	
Servlet
	    - life cycle. initial(init) - service - destroy(resource closing)
		- concept.
		- by nature it is multi threaded.
		- Request filter & Session filter. 
	
JDBC
		- Connection pooling.
		- create statement or prepared statement. difference.
		- callable statement. 
		
		
CustomerEntity(Id, name,Mobile,Address)	
OrderEntity(id,OrderNo,CustomerId,status)
select customerName,mobile,OrderNo,Status			
OrderDetailsResponseDTO(customerName,mobile,OrderNo,Status)		

ORM
		- JPA & Hibernate. (Java Persistence API specification & Hibernate is above layer implemented & we use both in SPRING)
		- sessionFactory is used to create Session Object, SessionFactory is thread safe also while session is not thread safe
		- sessionFactory.OpenSession vs sessionFactory.getCurrentSession 
		- JPA Multi Tenancy 
		- Hibernate Tuning - Strategies(SQL Optimization, Session mangement, data caching)
		- Hibernate Dirty checking --
		- Cache - Level1 (by default, session stored. Persists)
				- Level2 (it is not by default. it is used for session factory)
		- Beans/Entity States (transient, persists [ at this stage it comes in level1 cache.], detached)
		- Load()-- throw exception if Id not found vs Get() it will not throw exception rather then returns null
		- Relation & Assocation
		- Aggregation & Assocation & composition difference
		- Non entity me qisi result me safe krwalo?
			- non entity ka result set bna kr map krwalo.
			- result set new constructor bna kr save krleta hai.
		
- Hibernate Dirty checking question example
//cross cutting

try{
seession = sessionFactory.getCurrentSession();
seession.beginTransaction();
findCustomerById();
seession.commit();

Context Dependency Injection ---java ee 6
Spring
		- what it Spring? Inversion of Control. Dependency Injection.
		- Spring Container? manage Beans life cycle, what is bean life cycle? //ApplicationContext/ FactoryBean
		- Spring MVC.
		- Spring AOP. [cross concerend Implementation] Aspect Oriented Programming 
		- Spring Boot 
			- Advance
			- No need to additional configutation. provide auto configutation. 
			- in spring jdbc tempalte we have fix functionalities but in spring boot we have certain API and open to use by your need.
			- Light wieght. Embedded Server. -> TOMCAT , JEETY , UNDER-TWO
			- Best for Microservices architecture
			SerlvetDispatcher -> MVC controller  wraper to @RestController
		
		- Ways of Field Injection ? @Autowire
		- Constructor Injection -> IT IS THE BEST BECUASE. field by default singleton hi rahega. but constructor hi autowire rahega.
		- Setter Injection
		- XML file me bean bna kr map krwa dete hain. 
		- Annotaiton :- 
		@component - Parent Annotaiton [spring container me bean create krlega]
		@service - [for usage of service. extend component. use as a buisness entity]
		@transactional - JTA ki extend krti hai
		@RestController - class ko as a rest controller manta hai to expose as a controller.
		@Controller - class ko as a MVC controller.
		@configutation - configutation class hai.
